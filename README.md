# DATA-598-WI20-week-4
Goals for this activity to built a repo which has:
1. Uses starwars dataset & tidyverse
2. Has a plot and table (no need for captions and cross-reference because this is hard with some templates)
3. Has two in-text citations using bibtex
4. Has a user-friendly, polished structure
5. Has a set-up chunk, with 3+ settings
6. Uses code from an external R script file and knitr::read_chunk()
7. Uses a template from the rticles/papaja/tufte pkg or similar. If you get errors about TeX/LaTeX, tufte::tufte_html is a good option instead. You can delete the code and text in the template, but donâ€™t remove any YAML.
8. Uses knitr caching on at least one chunk
